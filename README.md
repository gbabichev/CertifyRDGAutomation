# CertifyRDGAutomation
Automates Certificate Renewal in Remote Desktop Gateway using Certify

Do you use Remote Desktop Gateway without a Remote Desktop Services Broker / Session hosts? 

Do you also use Let's Encrypt to generate SSL Certificates? 

This is for you.


This is an addon for CertifyTheWeb. Certify automatically updates your SSL Certificate in IIS, and this script will take that certificate and inject it into Remote Desktop Gateway!
